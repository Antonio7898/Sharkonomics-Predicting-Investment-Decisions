# Sharkonomics : Predicting Investment Decisions
This project aims to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of each Shark Tank investor making a deal, along with the potential investment range. 

By analyzing features such as company valuation, gross margin, revenue, current funding, product category, and pitch quality, the model aims to uncover valuable insights into successful pitches and investor preferences. 

This information can be valuable for entrepreneurs seeking investment, as well as investors looking for promising opportunities.
